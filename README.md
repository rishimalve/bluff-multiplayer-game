# Card Based Multiplayer Bluff Game 

This is a implmentation of Bluff Multiplayer Card Game playeble over a TCP/IP connection. We have used Python, Flask, Jinja2 and JQuery for this web application. 

Flask is used to enhance the web dev process, SQLAlchemy as the ORM and JQuery and HTML to create rich responsive frontends. AJAX and server-side scripting come into play and a REST API endpoint is designed too.
Security is given consideration too through certificates and regex validation to thwart basic attacks like XSS, CSRF and SQL injection attacks. Beyond that, logging is implemented to recover the system if it fails.
